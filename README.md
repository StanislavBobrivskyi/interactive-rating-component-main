# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

- I offer for your consideration a ready-made form ⬜️ ◻️ with the possibility to make a rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ assessment by the user.
- Technologies that were used to build the form:
  HTML; CSS; JS.

  - this form has the following functionality:

        - possibility of evaluation (so-called rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️) from 1⭐️ to 5⭐️;

        - after the user clicks on the selected button - the information about which rating⭐️ was selected is automatically recorded in the local storage 🔑 ;
        - the next steps are to press the button "Submit"✅;
        - but the attention ⚠️ button will not work if the user does not select any value ‼️ we will get ALERT window ‼️;

- After a successful submission ✅, we receive a new form ◻️ in which the user is thanked for the rating⭐️;
  - the form has information about which grade was selected;
- After three seconds, the page will automatically reload and return to the default (initial) state ↩️ .

  **Have fun building!** 🚀
